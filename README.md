## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Installation



## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! This project is designed to be community-driven, and we'd love to have you on board. Contributors will be recognized in our [Contributors section](#-contributor-recognition).

### How to Contribute

Follow these steps to contribute to the project:

#### 1. ⭐ Star the Repository (Pleas)

**This is important!** Giving the repository a star helps with visibility and makes the project more discoverable. This helps attract more contributors and grows the community. Your support means a lot! 🌟

#### 2. 🍴 Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karel-cz/react-ts-ui-lib)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

> **What is forking?** Forking creates your own copy of the project that you can modify without affecting the original.

#### 3. 📥 Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-ts-ui-lib.git
cd react-ts-ui-lib
```

Add the original repository as an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/karel-cz/react-ts-ui-lib.git
```

#### 4. 🛠️ Set Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ (recommended: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm))
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm i -ignore scrpits

```

**Run the demo application:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the demo app at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar) where you can see all components in action.

This builds the library package in the `library/ui/dist` directory.

#### 5. 🌿 Create a Branch from Development

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date
git fetch upstream
git checkout development
git pull upstream development

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name development
# or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/bug-description development
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/component-name` - For new components or features
- `fix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - For code refactoring

#### 6. ✏️ Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add proper type definitions
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes in the demo app

**Code style guidelines:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### 7. 🔄 Sync Before Committing

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always sync with the upstream `development` branch before committing!**

This is essential to avoid merge conflicts and ensure your changes work with the latest code.

**Step-by-step sync process:**

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Update your local development branch
git checkout development
git rebase upstream/development

# Go back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# Rebase your branch on the updated development
git rebase development
```

**Why is this important?**
- Avoids merge conflicts
- Ensures your code works with the latest changes
- Keeps the git history clean
- Makes code review easier

If you encounter conflicts during rebase, resolve them and continue:

```bash
# After resolving conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

#### 8. 💾 Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat(button): add loading state support`
- `fix(navbar): correct dark mode styling`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(icon): simplify icon rendering logic`

**Commit types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

#### 9. 🚀 Push and Create Pull Request

**Push your branch to your fork:**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

If you've rebased, you may need to force push (be careful with this):

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force-with-lease
```

**Create a Pull Request:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select `development` as the base branch (NOT `main`)
4. Select your feature branch
5. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Related issues (if any)
   - Testing notes

**PR Requirements:**
- All code must be properly formatted
- No console errors or warnings
- Changes should be tested in the demo app
- Documentation updated if needed

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **Git**: For version control

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or your fork):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karel-cz/react-ts-ui-lib.git
   cd react-ts-ui-lib
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the demo application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The demo app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Workspace Structure

This project uses npm workspaces (monorepo structure):

```
react-ts-ui-lib/
├── library/
│   └── ui/              # The main library package
│       └── src/
│           ├── basic-components/
│           └── tools/
├── apps/
│   └── demo/            # Demo application
│       └── src/
└── package.json         # Root package.json with workspaces
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Dependencies not installing correctly
- **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Issue**: Demo app not starting
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using Node.js 18+ and all dependencies are installed

**Issue**: Build errors
- **Solution**: Check TypeScript errors with `npm run build:ui` and fix any type issues
